# Home-Automation
This project enables home automation using NodeMCU ESP8266, DHT11 sensor, relays, and the Blynk IoT app. Control a fan and light remotely, with options for manual and automatic modes. The fan can switch automatically based on room temperature readings from the DHT11 sensor, providing a smart and energy-efficient solution for home comfort
